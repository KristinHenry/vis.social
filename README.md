# FAQ & Info

## What do these mean?

* Local timeline
	* The Local timeline is the heart of our community.
	* this is all the posts from accounts on this instance that are public. See 'unlisted'
	* If you're using a client that doesn't show you the 'Local timeline', you may use a browser to access the instance and stay connected with our community.


* Home timeline
	* Your home timeline has posts and boosts from accounts that you follow. These can be from your instance and other instances.

* Federated timeline
	* this is all the public posts on all of all public instances of mastodon (need to check on exactly how much)

* 'Off Topic' vs 'On Topic'

	* vis.social is a topic based instance, but our topics are fairly broad: "SciArt, SciVis SciComm, data science, data visualization, creative coding, and related arts and research".

	* are 'off-topic' posts ok? 
		* yes, but please in moderation. Try to keep your posts mostly on topic, but we are all full persons and have many interests and experiences
		* if you're not sure, use a CW as a 'Wrapper' or 'Headline', and let folks decide if they want to read your off-topic posts on the Local timeline.

* Unlisted posts

* Instance Rules

* Boosting

* Starring



* 'Alt-text', or Image Description
	* When you upload an image as part of your post, depending on your client, you should be able to add a description of the image...otherwise known as 'alt-text'.
	* Part of our function as moderators, is to boost posts from folks on our instance...but we'll only boost your posts if you've added alt-text to them. Sometimes, it's really hard for us to resist, but we're pushing ourselves to only boost images posts that have alt-text.
	* Bottom line, we're not going to suspend you for not bothering with alt-text, but we won't be boosting you.
	* After posting, you can still add alt-text in and edit. You have to edit the post, delete the image from the post, re-upload the image and add a 'description' which is alt-text.

* CW 

* Sensitive Content

* 'Algorithm' and timelines

* Interacting with accounts on other instances

* Sh+t-posting
	* Yeah, we all want to do it, but this isn't twitter, or whatever.
	* We're building a community, not individual broadcasting
	* We're all human, and sometimes, we just need to express!
		* That's cool, we all do that from time to time
		* But if all you do it sh+t-posting, maybe this isn't the instance for you. And actually, maybe Mastodon isn't for you at all.


* Reporting abuse and harassment
	* on our instance
	* from other instances


## How to...

### add alt-text to an image in a new post:

### Some common cases and things to say

* Case: post is not in English and doesn't have an English translation

	* Reply with 
	```
	Just a reminder that "English is the common language of the instance. Other languages are welcome, but please be kind and post English translations so that we can all read your posts."  https://vis.social/about
	```


* Case: post shows off-topic food photos:
	* Reply with
	```
	I'm not sure if you're aware, but we're asking folks to use a CW "content Wrapper" with "food" as the heading when posting photos of food and some other topics. 
	Fortunately, mastodon lets us edit posts and add CWs.
