# vis.social


There are different communities on Mastodon, and the greater Fediverse. They have different personalities, topics, and rules.

Before joining an instance (community), you should check to see if it looks like a good fit for you. Check the instance 'Rules'. Some might suprise you, but they usually exist for good reasons, and often because someting bad happened in the past.

**Vis.social** is a topic based community of creative people, especially anyone in SciArt, SciVis SciComm, data science, data visualization, creative coding, and related arts and research.

# FAQ & Info

## What do these mean?

### Instance vs Server vs Community
* These words are often used interchangebly, and some prefer one over another. They all basically refer to the same thing: software installed and running an a server, used by an online community.

### Local timeline
* The Local timeline is the heart of our community.
* this is all the posts from accounts on this instance that are public. See 'unlisted'
* If you're using a client that doesn't show you the 'Local timeline', you may use a browser to access the instance and stay connected with our community.


### Home timeline
* Your home timeline has posts and boosts from accounts that you follow. These can be from your instance and other instances.

### Federated timeline
* this is all the public posts on all of all public instances of mastodon (that our server interacts with).

### 'Off Topic' vs 'On Topic'

* vis.social is a topic based instance, but our topics are fairly broad: "SciArt, SciVis SciComm, data science, data visualization, creative coding, and related arts and research".

* are 'off-topic' posts ok? 
	* yes, but please in moderation. Try to keep your posts mostly on topic, but we are all full persons and have many interests and experiences
	* if you're not sure, use a CW as a 'Wrapper' or 'Headline', and let folks decide if they want to read your off-topic posts on the Local timeline.

### Unlisted Posts and Privacy Levels
* You can set the privacy level of your posts, but clicking on the 'globe' icon in the post interface. This will bring up a menu of options:
	* **Public**: it shows up in the Local timeline, and is fully public.
	* **Unlisted**: doesn not show up in the Local timeline.
	* **Followers only**: only your followers will see this.
	* **Mentioned only**: This is the equivalent to a DM on other platforms. They are not visible to anyone except the accounts mentioned. Moderators will not see these, unless someone mention reports it to the moderation team. Note: If you recieve an abusive mention, please report it, so that we can help keep vis.social a safer place.

### Instance Rules
* Every Mastodon instance/community has their own set of rules. 
* Please review our community Rules: https://vis.social/about

### Boosting
* Boosting is how Mastodon supports sharing posts. 
* Your followers will be able to see your boosts, if they haven't set their client to filter out boosts.


### Starring
* Unlike other platforms, starring has no impact on how often a post appears on anyone's timeline. There is no algorithm to manipulate.
* Starring is a lovely little note...when you don't have the words...to just say to the author "hey! I liked this!"



### 'Alt-text', or Image Description
* When you upload an image as part of your post, depending on your client, you should be able to add a description of the image...otherwise known as 'alt-text'.
* Part of our function as moderators, is to boost posts from folks on our instance...but we'll only boost your posts if you've added alt-text to them. Sometimes, it's really hard for us to resist, but we're pushing ourselves to only boost images posts that have alt-text.
* Bottom line, we're not going to suspend you for not bothering with alt-text, but we won't be boosting you.
* After posting, you can still add alt-text in and edit. You have to edit the post, ~~delete the image from the post, re-upload the image and add a 'description' which is alt-text.~~ We can now add alt-text while editing an existing post, just as if it were a new post.

### CW 
* While "CW" technically stands for "Content Warning", vis.social and most instances use it as a "Wrapper". It's a way of adding a content label, with is very useful for noting if a post is off-topic or might need a subject line.
* vis.social requires CWs for various subjects, including food, alchohol. Check our Rules for current topics require (or request) CWs on. 
* It's easy to add a CW while writing your post. You can even edit an extisting post and add a CW.
* Additional info: 
	* https://maloki.medium.com/on-content-warnings-on-mastodon-318771be78e8
	

### Sensitive Content
* when uploading an image or video, you can check the 'Mark as Sensitive' option.
* anything that might need to be marked as sensitive, should probably also have a CW.


### 'Algorithm' and timelines
* Unlike many social media platforms, Mastodon does not use an 'algorithm' to control what shows up in your timeline. 

### Interacting with accounts on other instances:

* ToDo!

### Sh+t-posting:
* Yeah, we all want to do it, but this isn't twitter, or whatever.
* We're building a community, not individual broadcasting
* We're all human, and sometimes, we just need to express!
	* That's cool, we all do that from time to time
	* Try to remember to make these posts as 'Unlisted' or 'Followers Only', and not on the Local Timeline.
	* But if all you do it sh+t-posting, maybe this isn't the instance for you. 

### Reporting abuse and harassment
* ToDo: write this
	* on our instance
	* from other instances

### upload a video

* Please avoid uploading directly to our servers.
* Instead, please upload to another service and post the link here.
* Why? To avoid using up our server space and increasing the cost of running this istance/community servers.

## Tools and habits for supporting a diverse community?
* hashtags
* CWs...
* unlisted posts...

## What can I customize for myself?



## Why didn't you write this earlier?

The massive influx of folks in late 2022, was a bit overwhelming to keep up with. Mastodon is evolving, and we're figuring out what this means for us at the same time. So, this is a work-in-progress.


#-------------------------------------------------

# Moderator and Admin tools and challenges

The Mastodon software that runs on our server comes with a lot of tools to help us build, support, and protect our community. Some of them are great, and some could use improvements. We work with the tools we have.


## Moderators

### What's involved in being a moderator?

* Pace yourself! It's easy to get overwhelmed and burn out. It's easy to get lost down fascinating rabbit holes, loose track of time, and burn out. If you need to, give yourself time limits. 

* Boost insteresting posts from our community, and beyond -- images should have alt-text

* Help process reports for our community, and participate in discussions of reports that are unclear. 

* Remind folks to add CWs for off-topic posts that include images of food, etc. check our current guidelines.

* Help folks learn how to add CWs and edit posts, and so on. 


* We're also considering some optional community building activites, but they're still on the back-bench for now.


### How much time does it involve?

Usually, it's just a few minutes a day. 

Occassionally, an issue comes up that needs to be dealt with. This can be a minor thing in our community. But sometimes, it's a case of bad actors on other instances attacking/harassing our community members (these attacks are usually targetting many comunites, not just ours). These are usually quick to deal with, but are sometimes more involved. In these cases, you'd want to get in touch with the moderation team.


### Some common cases and things to say, when you see a post on our instance that needs reminders about our policies and rules.


* Case: a new application looks topic-related, but the person clearly has not read our Rules:
   * send an email from curator @ vis.social

   * email subject:
   ```
   Action Required: Your application to join vis.social

   ```
   * text of email: 
   ```

	* Reply with
	```
	I'm not sure if you're aware, but we're asking folks to use a CW "content Wrapper" with "food" as the heading when posting photos of food and some other topics.

### How to moderate a report

...

### Levels of action

...


### Admin Tasks
There are tools that only Admins have access too in the Moderation interface.

## Domain Level Limiting and Suspending (Blocking)

* Start with a Limit! 

### What we do when there is a Spam Wave:

* With the help of our community members report spam, we can see patterns more quickly.

* When spam wave reports start coming in:
	* open the reports and look at what instance domains they are coming from
	* open the moderation interface for that domain
		* if we have any connections with that domain, place the domain on Limit. The limit may be lifted, after the wave is over. We have had to do this several times with some of the larger instances.
		* if we have no connections with the domain, a Suspend might be in order.
		* Look to see how old the domain is, and if there are active accounts on that domain that seem valid. If the domain seems to have been abandoned, and taken over by spammers, Suspend the domain.
