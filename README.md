# FAQ & Info

## What do these mean?

* Local timeline
	* The Local timeline is the heart of our community.
	* this is all the posts from accounts on this instance that are public. See 'unlisted'
	* If you're using a client that doesn't show you the 'Local timeline', you may use a browser to access the instance and stay connected with our community.


* Home timeline
	* Your home timeline has posts and boosts from accounts that you follow. These can be from your instance and other instances.

* Federated timeline
	* this is all the public posts on all of all public instances of mastodon (need to check on exactly how much)

* 'Off Topic' vs 'On Topic'

	* vis.social is a topic based instance, but our topics are fairly broad: "SciArt, SciVis SciComm, data science, data visualization, creative coding, and related arts and research".

	* are 'off-topic' posts ok? 
		* yes, but please in moderation. Try to keep your posts mostly on topic, but we are all full persons and have many interests and experiences
		* if you're not sure, use a CW as a 'Wrapper' or 'Headline', and let folks decide if they want to read your off-topic posts on the Local timeline.

* Unlisted posts

* Instance Rules

* Boosting

* Starring



* 'Alt-text', or Image Description
	* When you upload an image as part of your post, depending on your client, you should be able to add a description of the image...otherwise known as 'alt-text'.
	* Part of our function as moderators, is to boost posts from folks on our instance...but we'll only boost your posts if you've added alt-text to them. Sometimes, it's really hard for us to resist, but we're pushing ourselves to only boost images posts that have alt-text.
	* Bottom line, we're not going to suspend you for not bothering with alt-text, but we won't be boosting you.
	* After posting, you can still add alt-text in and edit. You have to edit the post, ~~delete the image from the post, re-upload the image and add a 'description' which is alt-text.~~ We can now add alt-text while editing an existing post, just as if it were a new post.

* CW 

* Sensitive Content

* 'Algorithm' and timelines

* Interacting with accounts on other instances

* Sh+t-posting
	* Yeah, we all want to do it, but this isn't twitter, or whatever.
	* We're building a community, not individual broadcasting
	* We're all human, and sometimes, we just need to express!
		* That's cool, we all do that from time to time
		* But if all you do it sh+t-posting, maybe this isn't the instance for you. And actually, maybe Mastodon isn't for you at all.


* Reporting abuse and harassment
	* on our instance
	* from other instances


## How to...

### add alt-text to an image in a new post:

1. open the 'edit' option on the image
2. Add text describing the image, or edit existing descriptive text.

<img src="/images/editAltText.jpg" alt="Adding Alt Text" width="200">


### add alt-text to an image in an **existing** post:

1. open the 'edit' option on your post
<img src="/images/editingPost_2.jpg" alt="Editing A Post" width="200">

2. open the 'edit' option on the image
<img src="/images/editAltText.jpg" alt="Adding Alt Text" width="200">

3. Add text describing the image, or edit existing descriptive text.


### upload a video

* Please avoid uploading directly to our servers.
* Instead, please upload to another service and post the link here.
* Why? To avoid using up our server space and increasing the cost of running this istance/community servers.

## Tools and habits for supporting a diverse community?
* hashtags
* CWs...
* unlisted posts...

## What can I customize for myself?



## Why didn't you write this earlier?

The massive influx of folks in late 2022, was a bit overwhelming to keep up with. Mastodon is evolving, and we're figuring out what this means for us at the same time. So, this is a work-in-progress.

# Moderator and Admin tools and challenges

The Mastodon software that runs on our server comes with a lot of tools to help us build our community. Some of them are great, and some could use improvements. But we work with the tools we have.


## Moderators

### What's involved in being a moderator?

* Pace yourself! It's easy to get overwhelmed and burn out. It's easy to get lost down fascinating rabbit holes, loose track of time, and burn out. If you need to, give yourself time limits. 

* Boost insteresting posts from our community, and beyond -- images should have alt-text

* Process reports for our community. 

* Remind folks to add CWs for off-topic posts that include images of food, etc. check our current guidelines.

* If signups are open, help proccess applications to join the instance (community). New sign ups are currently closed.

* We're also considering some optional community building activites, but they're still on the back-bench for now.


### How much time does it involve?

Usually, it's just a few minutes a day. 

Occassionally, an issue comes up that needs to be dealt with. This can be a minor thing in our community. But sometimes, it's a case of bad actors on other instances attacking/harassing our community members (these attacks are usually targetting many comunites, not just ours). These are usually quick to deal with, but are sometimes more involved. In these cases, you'd want to get in touch with the moderation team.


### Some common cases and things to say, when you see a post on our instance that needs reminders about our policies and rules.

* Case: post is not in English and doesn't have an English translation

	* Reply with 
	```
	Just a reminder that "English is the common language of the instance. Other languages are welcome, but please be kind and post English translations so that we can all read your posts."  https://vis.social/about
	```


* Case: post shows off-topic food photos:
	* Reply with
	```
	I'm not sure if you're aware, but we're asking folks to use a CW "content Wrapper" with "food" as the heading when posting photos of food and some other topics. 
	Fortunately, mastodon lets us edit posts and add CWs.
	```

* Case: post about AI/ChatGPT:
	* Reply with 
	```
	Just a gentle reminder about CW's on our Local timeline and our instance rules: https://vis.social/about 
	CW on AI topics. Please add CW for posts about AI, especially tools like ChatGPT. 
	```
